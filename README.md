 Note Taker

# The Assignment: Note Taker

* GIVEN a note-taking application

* WHEN I open the Note Taker

* THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page

* WHEN I click on the link to the notes page

* THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

* WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text

* THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page

* WHEN I click on the Save icon

* THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes

* WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column

* THEN that note appears in the right-hand column

* WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page

* THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

This assignment was a much different one than all the rest because we were given the front end code and needed to connect to the backend server. The above criteria was already built on the frontend so initially doing and npm init -y then use npm install to bring the node modules for the assignment once that was done I created a gitignore file so I didn't push a lot of unnecessary files to git hub. The next step was to create a server.js file that would host a port route and show if it was live I used localhost 8080 to test the connection develop it locally. Once that was done I needed to create the routes. The API route takes the data and saves it to the db.jon file so it can be accessed at a later time, deleted, modified, etc. The HTML route allows the user to move between pages using a specific definition that will be dictated in the final deployed URL. Also I was able to do the bonus and DELETE the posted notes. 

# Lessons: 
This assignment allowed me to use, write, and test code from the backend server. I was able to create the server on the localhost use a specific port tell it to listen. Then I was able to direct the data using routes labeled in the repo api-route and html-route. This assignment was also challenging because it needed to be deployed to heroku which was a totally different way to publish a website that we have never done before this was another experience to take from this assignment. I have not had any experience so far in the Bootcamp with creating a full application from the front to the back and though we were given starter code for the front it all had to be brought together and this was a great lesson to take from this assignment. 

# Takeaways:
Difficulty from 0 to 10 this was a 10 also frustration a 10 but with all this so many lessons learned and so many takeaways from it my mind is blown. I also had everything working and tested but it wasn't showing up on the page and I took a small break to return to a fully functioning webpage it was all written and routed correctly but the server aka my computer was taking a minute to catch up and when it did it was a joyful moment i wrote the code and it worked. This was a very joyful experience and one of the biggest and best takeaways from this assignment.
